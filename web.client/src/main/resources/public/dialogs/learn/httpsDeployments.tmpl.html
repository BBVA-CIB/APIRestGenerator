			<p>If you are using Spring Boot and want to enable SSL (https) for your application, there a few short steps you will need to take.</p>
	
			<ol>
			  <li><strong>Get yourself a SSL certificate</strong>: generate a self-signed certificate or get one from a Certificate Authority</li>
			  <li><strong>Enable HTTPS in Spring Boot</strong></li>
			</ol>
	
			<h4 id="step-1-get-a-ssl-certificate">Step 1: Get a SSL certificate</h4>
	
			<p>If you want to use SSL and serve your Spring Boot application over HTTPS you will need to get a certificate.</p>
	
			<p>You have two options to get one. You can generate a self-signed certificate, which will most likely be what you will want to do in development 
			   since it is the easiest option. This usually is not a good option in production since it will display a warning to the user that your certificate 
			   is not trusted (a correct way is to request one from a Certificate Authority)</p>
	
			<p>Since we are developers, we are going to generate a self-signed certificate to get started quickly with development of our application. 
			   Every Java Runtime Environment (JRE) comes bundled with a certificate management utility, 
			   <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html" target="_blank">keytool</a>. 
			   This can be used to generate our self-signed certificate. You can have a look:</p>
	

			<pre>
				<code class="bash">
	keytool -genkey -alias myexample -storetype PKCS12 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 3650
		
	Enter keystore password:
	 Re-enter new password:
	 What is your first and last name?
	 <span class="o">[</span>Unknown<span class="o">]</span>:
	 What is the name of your organizational unit?
	 <span class="o">[</span>Unknown<span class="o">]</span>:
	 What is the name of your organization?
	 <span class="o">[</span>Unknown<span class="o">]</span>:
	 What is the name of your City or Locality?
	 <span class="o">[</span>Unknown<span class="o">]</span>:
	 What is the name of your State or Province?
	 <span class="o">[</span>Unknown<span class="o">]</span>:
	 What is the two-letter country code <span class="k">for</span> this unit?
	 <span class="o">[</span>Unknown<span class="o">]</span>:
	 Is <span class="nv">CN</span><span class="o">=</span>Unknown, <span class="nv">OU</span><span class="o">=</span>Unknown, <span class="nv">O</span><span class="o">=</span>Unknown, <span class="nv">L</span><span class="o">=</span>Unknown, <span class="nv">ST</span><span class="o">=</span>Unknown, <span class="nv">C</span><span class="o">=</span>Unknown correct?
	 <span class="o">[</span>no<span class="o">]</span>: yes
				</code>
			</pre>
	
			<p>This will generate a PKCS12 keystore called keystore.p12 with your newly generate certificate in it, with certificate alias <code>myexample</code>. 
			You will need to reference the keystore in a minute when we start to configure Spring Boot (For this example, the keystore must be stored in the root project)</p>
			
			<h4 id="step-2-enable-https-in-spring-boot">Step 2: Enable HTTPS in Spring Boot</h4>
			
			<p>By default your Spring Boot embedded container will have HTTP on port 8080 enabled. Spring Boot lets you configure HTTP or HTTPS in the application.properties, 
			   but not both at once. If you want to enable both you will need to configure at least one programmatically. 
			   The Spring Boot reference <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-configure-ssl" target="_blank">documentation</a> recommends 
			   configuring HTTPS in the application.properties since it is the more complicated than HTTP.</p>
			
			<p>We are going to configure HTTPS in the default <code>application.properties</code> file under <code>src/main/resources</code> of your Spring Boot application:</p>
	
			<pre>
				<code class="bash">
	<span class="na">server.port</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">8443</span>
	<span class="na">server.ssl.key-store</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">keystore.p12</span>
	<span class="na">server.ssl.key-store-password</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">mypassword</span>
	<span class="na">server.ssl.keyStoreType</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">PKCS12</span>
	<span class="na">server.ssl.keyAlias</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">myexample</span>
				</code>
			</pre>
			
			<p>There is a common issue when the keyAlias is defined: keytool converts the upper case of character to lower case automatically, then we advice to always 
			define this value as lower case </p>
			<p>That is all you need to do to make your application accessible over HTTPS on <code>https://localhost:8443</code>, pretty easy right?</p>
